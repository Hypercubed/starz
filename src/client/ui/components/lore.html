    Nobody knows why <i>The Bubble</i> exists, or who built the lattice
    of hyperspace lanes threading its hundreds of star systems together
    like a cosmic web. Its discovery was accidental - a distortion
    ripple detected on the edge of settled space, leading explorers to
    the shimmering boundary of a region where physics seemed... wrong.
  </p>
  <p>
    What <i>is</i> known is this: control of <i>The Bubble</i> means
    control of immense resources and power. Rival factions flood its
    systems, each desperate to carve out their claim before somebody
    else does.

  <p>
    As a commander, you are the spearhead of your faction's ambitions:
    tasked with expanding your influence, capturing systems, and
    ultimately dominating <i>The Bubble</i>.
