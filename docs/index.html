      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        This is a simple strategy game where you control a number of star
        systems and try to conquer the the Bubble. The Bubble is a cluster of
        star systems connected by hyperspace lanes. You start with one system
        and must expand your control by sending ships to capture other systems.
      </p>

      <h3>Gameplay</h3>
      <p>
        The game is played in real-time, with each turn lasting 1 second. You
        begin the game controlling one system, your homeworld. Each turn, your
        homeworld and any other inhabited systems you control, will produce an
        additional ship. You can send these ships to other systems to capture
        them. Each controlled system receives an additional ship each 25 turns.
        To transfer ships, click on a system you control and then click on a
        target system. This will send all available ships, less one, from the
        source system to the target system. Click on the hyperspace lane between
        the selected system and the target system to send half of the available
        ships. If the target system is uninhabited, you will capture it
        automatically. If the target system is controlled by another player, a
        battle will ensue. The player with the most ships on the target system
        after all ships have arrived will take control of the system.
      </p>
      <h3>Objective</h3>
      <p>
        The goal is to eliminate all other player's homeworlds and control the
        entire Bubble.
