## Mastering Moves

There are three ways to move your fleet. Mastering these is key to victory.

### 1. Basic Move (Attack/Reinforce)
Send ships from one system to another.

*   **How**: Select a system you own (Left-click), then **Right-click** on any target system.
*   **Result**: Ships will launch from the selected system to the target.

### 2. Balanced Move
Quickly equalize defenses between two connected neighbors.

*   **How**: **Right-click on the lane** (the line) connecting two of your systems.
*   **Result**: Ships will automatically transfer until both systems have roughly the same number of units.
*   **Use when**: You just captured a system and need to reinforce it quickly from a safe backline system.

### 3. Multisystem Move (Coordinated Attack)
Overwhelm a strong enemy by attacking from multiple directions at once.

*   **How**:
    1.  Select your first system.
    2.  Hold **Ctrl** and **Left-click** other systems to add them to your selection.
    3.  **Right-click** the target system.
*   **Result**: All selected systems that have a connection to the target will launch ships simultaneously.
*   **Use when**: Breaking a heavily fortified enemy homeworld.
